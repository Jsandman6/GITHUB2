# GITHUB2
Week 1
I learned how to run a bias-variance tradeoff. I learned how to evaluate models as well. I was pretty new to data science but I have experience using R. 

Week 2
I learned transformation of data and exploring data using visualization. I created graphs before but I was able to create indepth graphs during this week.

Week 3
I learned linear regression. I was able to find other ways to visualize linear regression unlike before when I did not have the experience to do this.

Week 4
I learned logistic regression. I was also able to run performance measures against any of the models I was using.

Week 5
I learned about the different kinds of regression outside of logistic and linear. I also learned about GLMs which I had never used before.

Week 6
I learned about decision trees and random forests. I used both of these in discrete mathematics but not as in depth as I used in this class.

Week 7
I learned about KClustering and how to visualize this. I had never used either of these before so learning this was an interesting concept for me.

Week 8
I learned about GitHub commands and doing presentations with R. I have not used GitHub as much before until having to using the Git now.
